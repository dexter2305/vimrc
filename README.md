# vimrc
Runtime configuration for GVim 

## Installation

  - Git clone this repository
      `git clone https://github.com/dexter2305/vimrc.git $repoDir`
  - Create soft link ${repoDir}/vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc
      `ln -s ${repoDir}/vim $HOME/.vimrc`


## Plugin Manager
  - Uses 'vim-plug' plugin manager. Plugin manager is downloaded during initial bootup. 

### Note
    - Auto installation of plugins declared fails. Hence, auto-installation of plugins is removed. After the first time bootup, try manual installation of plugins as a one-time task.
    - Refer vim-plug documentation [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) of vim-plug commands.
